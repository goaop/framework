/**
 * Base class for all framework interceptor implementations
 *
 * This class describe an action taken by the interceptor at a particular joinpoint.
 * Different types of interceptors include "around", "before" and "after" advices.
 *
 * Around interceptor is an advice that surrounds a joinpoint such as a method invocation. This is the most powerful
 * kind of advice. Around advices will perform custom behavior before and after the method invocation. They are
 * responsible for choosing whether to proceed to the joinpoint or to shortcut executing by returning their own return
 * value or throwing an exception.
 *
 * After and before interceptors are simple closures that will be invoked after and before main invocation.
 *
 * Framework models an interceptor as an PHP-closure, maintaining a chain of interceptors "around" the joinpoint:
 *   public function (Joinpoint $joinPoint)
 *   {
 *      echo 'Before action';
 *      // call chain here with Joinpoint->proceed() method
 *      $result = $joinPoint->proceed();
 *      echo 'After action';
 *
 *      return $result;
 *   }
