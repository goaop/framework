 * invocation is the runtime joinpoint on a method (static joinpoint).
 * The static part of a given joinpoint can be generically retrieved

 * is then the reification of an access to an accessible object (a
 * method, a constructor, a field), i.e. the static part of the
 * joinpoint. It is passed to the interceptors that are installed on
 * the static joinpoint.
